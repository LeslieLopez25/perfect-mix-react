## My process

### Built with

- React JS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Using the position property is very handy in having a lot of control of where you want everything to be positioned in but for me it meant adding in a lot of code in to my css which ended up being 1000+ lines to my css file. Along the way of building this landing page I realized that I need to focus on learning more on flexbox and grid as I saw that it would make it easier to write my code out and have everything positioned right without having to use so much code and when I did try to use flexbox and grid I ended up having trouble understand how to use it. With media queries I had trouble with it just like I did with flexbox and grid but I managed a bit more better. This project was the first time that I've ever did a challenge for and the first time that I didn't follow a tutorial but instead did on my own and had to figure out the issues with the code on myself and see where I need to improve on. This project took longer than I thought, being around 1 month and 11 days, deleted a lot of code and and rewrote a lot more, and had days where I just wanted to pull my hair out but I finally finished it and I'm proud of myself and mt journey to completing this project :grin:
